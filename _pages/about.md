I am a PhD student in computational math ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)) at Stanford University, advised by [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/). My research interests are broadly related to combining state space models and deep learning approaches to improve sequence modeling. Before Stanford, I obtained a master's degree at MIT in the [LGO](https://lgo.mit.edu/) program and attended undergrad at Georgia Tech.
